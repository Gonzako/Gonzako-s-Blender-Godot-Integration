# Gonzako's-Blender-Godot-Integration
OS agnostic rewrite of the Dogwalk Blender to Godot pipeline with some minor improvements. 

## Project structure
The plugin assumes the following project structure:

    [Godot project]\
    |_ blender project\
      |_ where .blend files will be placed. Subfolders are allowed
    |_ exported game\
      |_ where exported assest will be placed and processed into their respective .tscn


## Current plan
Getting the plugin into an initial working state for exporting assets is the main goal at this very moment

## Future plans
· A simple onboarding experience where downloading the plugin from the Godot website should just work.

· Animation and character exports
